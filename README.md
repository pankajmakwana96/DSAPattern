## Patterns Covered

### 1. Two Pointers Pattern
**Status**: ✅ 14 problems with full implementation, 5 advanced problems with detailed approaches

The Two Pointers pattern is used to solve array and string problems efficiently by using two pointers that traverse the data structure in a coordinated manner.

**Problems with Full Java & C++ Implementation**:
1. Valid Palindrome (Easy)
2. 3Sum (Medium)
3. Remove Nth Node from End of List (Medium)
4. Sort Colors - Dutch National Flag (Medium)
5. Reverse Words in a String (Medium)
6. Valid Word Abbreviation (Easy)
7. Strobogrammatic Number (Easy)
8. Count Pairs Whose Sum is Less than Target (Easy)
9. Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence (Medium)
10. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III (Medium)
11. Count Subarrays With Fixed Bounds (Hard)
12. Squares of a Sorted Array (Easy)
13. Reverse String (Easy)
14. Valid Palindrome II (Easy)

**Advanced Problems with Detailed Approaches**:
15. Get the Maximum Score (Hard)
16. Minimum Number of Moves to Make Palindrome (Hard)
17. Next Palindrome Using Same Digits (Hard)
18. Lexicographically Largest String From Box II (Hard)
19. Create Maximum Number (Hard)

See [Two-Pointers/README.md](Two-Pointers/README.md) for detailed pattern explanation.

## How to Use This Repository

### For Learning
1. Start with the pattern README to understand the concept
2. Read the problem description and try to solve it yourself
3. Review the approaches and understand different solutions
4. Study the code implementations
5. Run the test cases to verify understanding

### For Interview Preparation
1. Practice problems by difficulty: Easy → Medium → Hard
2. Focus on understanding the pattern, not memorizing code
3. Pay attention to edge cases and complexity analysis
4. Try to implement solutions without looking at the code

**Total Problems**: 19 problems (14 with full Java & C++ code + 5 with detailed approaches)

**Languages**: Java, C++

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to a pattern directory (e.g., `Two-Pointers/`)
3. Read the pattern README for an overview
4. Pick a problem and start coding!

```bash
# Example: Compile and run Java solution
javac ValidPalindrome.java
java ValidPalindrome

# Example: Compile and run C++ solution
g++ -std=c++17 ValidPalindrome.cpp -o ValidPalindrome
./ValidPalindrome
```

## Notes

- All Java files are standalone and can be compiled/run independently
- C++ files use standard library (STL) and require C++11 or later
- Test cases are included in main() methods
- Solutions prioritize clarity and correctness over extreme optimization
